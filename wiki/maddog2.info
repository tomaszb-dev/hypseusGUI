The anonymous main character must track down the wanted outlaw himself, eliminating any and all gang members and hostiles along the way. From the introduction, one can conclude that he or she will be up against renegade Indians, banditos, and "Mad Dog's sleazy crew".
The player proceeds through the game, first by taking a preparatory shooting lesson with a stagecoach driver – played by Ben Zeller, who appeared in the role of the prospector in the original game – and then by choosing one of three guides: Buckskin Bonnie, the Professor, and Shooting Beaver. Each guide takes the player along a different, unique route, but they converge in the game's final shootouts, which take place inside a moving train and in Mad Dog's hideout. The latter scene is especially lengthy and culminates with a showdown with McCree himself.
However, hunting down and defeating the infamous gunfighter is not the player's only goal. Mad Dog has hidden a chest full of treasure in his hideout, and it is up to the player to get it back from him. At times, the player will discover that the treasure chest is full of sand and obviously does not contain the "lost gold".
The player is guided along a path and must shoot the villains before they manage to hit the player character. A special cursor is used to specify the location the player is aiming at. There is also a limited number of bullets in the chamber. However, reloading can be done an infinite number of times.
Like Mad Dog McCree, The Last Bounty Hunter, and Fast Draw Showdown, Mad Dog II contains random scenes in which the player takes part in a showdown against one or more gunfighters. The player starts out with an empty chamber and must quickly reload when given the chance, and proceed to eliminate the enemy as fast as possible. Shooting practice at the beginning of the game involves hitting cow skulls, signposts, and such from a stagecoach in motion.
The player must avoid getting shot and hitting innocent civilians. If one of these occurs, the player loses one of three lives, and a short clip is displayed, often showing an undertaker giving advice or criticizing the player's actions.
